## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5** markup

- **Flexbox**
- **CSS Grid**
- **Mobile-first workflow**
-**HSL color scheme**

2. **Styling**:
   Styling applied using 'hsl' for consistent theming.
   - Grid layout for main sections.
   - Buttons styled with hover states.

3. **images**:
   -Desktop and mobile images dynamically adjusted to match the screen size.

## What I learned

This project helped me improve my skills in:
- Structuring HTML for clarity and maintainability.
- creating responsive designs using '@media' queries.
- Using 'hsl' color values for a consistent, easy-to-edit color scheme.
- Layout techniques like **CSS Grid** for creating flexible and adaptive designs.

###Challenges Faced
- Aligning the "New" section and the "Bright Future of Web 3.0" content as per the design.
- Ensuring proper spacing and alignment for all components on both desktop and mobile.

### Continued development
